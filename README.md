This project is based on a youtube video by [SociallyIneptWeeb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY7sRB60wZ4)

Everything is done in python and reproduce the basics of the video.

## How to use

BEWARE: This is a very early version of the project, and it is not very user friendly.
Plus, it only works on windows.

### Install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

you will also need docker with voicevox_engine installed, and a container with whisper.
A dockerfile will be provided in the future (if I'm not too lazy).

### Run the script

```bash
python main.py
```

## How to use the script

simply press and hold the space bar to start recording.
